**Codewise** is a CLI tool that provides a basic set of commands to perform tedious tasks such as converting **YAML to JSON** or **JSON to YAML** directly from your terminal. It's built with [GoLang](https://github.com/golang/go), [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra), [Viper](https://github.com/spf13/viper), etc.
 
To install the Codewise-CLI, use the command `go install github.com/aryansharma9917/Codewise-CLI@latest`.
Go will automatically install it in your `$GOPATH/bin` directory, which should be in your `$PATH`

Once installed, you can use the `Codewise-CLI` CLI command. To confirm installation, type `Codewise-CLI` at the command line interface.

> **Note** If you are getting an error like `command not found: Codewise-CLI`, then you need to add `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH` environment variable.
